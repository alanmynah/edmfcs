# Essential Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science

My attempts at solving problems in edmfs book.

I have emailed to request an exam copy and pinky promised to not share it anywhere, as [described here](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691179292/essential-discrete-mathematics-for-computer-science), but didn't get any reply, so these solutions are just my possible solutions and explanations. If I get requested to take it done or make it private, I unfortunately will have to comply.

But if you've got the official solutions, could you please email/message/pigeon me?

FYI, i just can't be bothered with Latex, so this is following 2019 edition, so ordering should be the same.
